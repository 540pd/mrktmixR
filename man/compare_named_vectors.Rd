\title{Compare Named Vectors}
\usage{
compare_named_vectors(base_vector, comparison_vector)
}
\arguments{
\item{base_vector}{A named numeric vector that serves as the base for comparison.}

\item{comparison_vector}{A named numeric vector that is compared against the base vector.}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector where each element from the base vector is matched
with the corresponding element in the comparison vector by name.
If a name from the base vector does not exist in the comparison vector,
the corresponding value in the returned vector is NA.
}
\description{
This function compares two named numeric vectors. It creates a new vector
with names from the base vector and values matched from the comparison vector.
If a name in the base vector does not exist in the comparison vector,
its corresponding value in the output is set to NA.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
base_vector <- c(Alice = 10, Bob = 15, Charlie = 20)
comparison_vector <- c(Alice = 5, David = 18, Bob = 12)
compare_named_vectors(base_vector, comparison_vector)
}
